                    state updates.
                     Integrated a reminder system where users can set start and end times, and the app displays a
                    countdown to task deadlines.
                     Designed a clean, user-friendly UI using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, ensuring accessibility and
                    responsiveness across devices.
                     Leveraged React Hooks for state and effect management, ensuring optimal rendering performance.
                     Deployed the application using GitHub Pages, showcasing hands-on experience with project hosting
                    and deployment.

                     This project demonstrates practical knowledge in React development, time-based logic, and frontend
                    deployment workflows.
